# Geospatial
The Geospatial project under Antony_project is a project which studies the HDB resale market and after which goes into utilising Heatmap to showcase the no. of resale units in the area. Subsequently the folium map is used as a better alternative to display the grouping of resale units

The map will interactively display HDB resale units in singapore and help provide an overview of the number of units within an area. The aesthetically pleasing way the grouping is done is through the used of folium which helps gorup the HDB units as you zoom out and disassemble when you zoom in to their respective coordinates.
