Interactive map
==
***
The first map was created with Heatmap to showcase the no. of resale units in the area. Methods of how to use heatmap can be seen under HDB_resale_folium

The second map was created with Markercluster in python which helps present data at particular geographic location (Singapore) in an aesthetically pleasing way
The map will interactively display HDB resale units in singapore and help provide an overview of the number of units within an area. The aesthetically pleasing way the grouping is done is through the used of folium which helps gorup the HDB units as you zoom out and disassemble when you zoom in to their respective coordinates.
